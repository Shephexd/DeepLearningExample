## Deep learning
Scratch with numpy and tensorflow for Deep learning algorithms with examples. Edit

### Basic concept
- Perception
- Neural network
- Forward propagation
- Backward propagation
- Dropout
- Batch
- SoftMax
- Loss function

### Neural networks
- CNN(Convolutional Neural Network)
- RNN(Recurrent Neural network)
- D-Q Learning(Deep Q learning)
- GAN(Generative Adaptive Network)

I hope it will be helpful to understand concepts and algortihms for deep learning i made.
And if you find any problems and some errors on my code, please let me know the problem you have.
I am still learning and testing this library with Jupyter notebook to make it easy to be understandable.
